          Hey✌️ My name is Olwethu Bhiya, and I am grateful to have the chance to introduce myself to you. I have the ability to code and design a
          fully functional website pushing past my limits as do so. I'm a motivated, passionate person that constantly looks for new
          opportunities. I enjoy having the chance to develop, learn, and overcome challenges wherever I go. I can't wait to keep traveling,
          pushing limits and aim for my perfection in everything I do.

        <p class="about">
          I consider computer work to be a major passion of mine, and I work hard to develop my abilities, But when I'm not working, I like to read, dance, be active (Sports, exercise and outdoor adventures) and play video games. I can escape my environment by participating in these interests. I approach life with a positive view and an open mind, and I am able to welcome new opportunities, create important connections, and make the most of any situation.
